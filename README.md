# Data Structures & Algorithms – Interview Preparation

This repository contains my implementations and notes for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** as part of systematic interview preparation.  
The focus is on **fundamental data structures**, **core algorithms**, and **clear, low-level implementations** (primarily in C/C++), along with selected conceptual documentation.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of core data structures
- Practice implementation from scratch (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)
- Prepare for technical interviews with clean, readable code
- Maintain revision-friendly references and notes
